# HashSets
HashSets repo contains hash sets that I have used during analysis of both Mobile and PC forensic analysis. 


MD5-Non-Pertinent_Files is a MD5 hash set I have created over the years which contains MD5 hashes for files I have determined to be non-pertinent during my exams. This hash set primarily consists of Mobile device non-pertinent files but is a combined list and does contain some computer non-pertinent files.  


Please use caution when using any hash sets within this repo. You must validate any hash match, prior to removing files/artifacts from your examination and analysis reports. 


I use NSRL to assist with filtering out non-Pertinent files. I pulled the Android, iOS , and Modern Minimal MD5s from the 2023-3 NSRL RDSv3 files and put them into txt files. The are in the 7zip file if you wish to use them. Here are the hash counts and the hash for the 7zip file:
