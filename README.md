# HashSets
HashSets repo contains hash sets that I have used during analysis of both Mobile and PC forensic analysis. 


MD5-Non-Pertinent_Files is a MD5 hash set I have created over the years which contains MD5 hashes for files I have determined to be non-pertinent during my exams. This hash set primarily consists of Mobile device non-pertinent files but is a combined list and does contain some computer non-pertinent files.  


Please use caution when using any hash sets within this repo. You must validate any hash match, prior to removing files/artifacts from your examination and analysis reports.
